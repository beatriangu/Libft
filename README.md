# Libft
Custom C Library;
This project is a customized C library designed to enhance C programming skills. It involves re-implementing standard library functions to deepen understanding and proficiency in C. I ended up completing this library three times, initially aiming to optimize it by reusing functions. Later, I decided it was better to keep the implementations pure in case I needed them for other projects. This version is the one I presented, showcasing various approaches to solving the same problem. :)
